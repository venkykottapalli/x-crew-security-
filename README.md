## Features

### Antinuke
High-speed protection against unauthorized server destruction. The bot monitors audit logs in real time and instantly bans any user performing restricted actions — even those with Administrator permissions — unless they are the Server Owner or whitelisted.

**Monitored actions:**
- Channel create / delete / update
- Role create / delete / update
- Webhook create / update
- Guild updates (name, icon, vanity URL)
- Integration changes
- Mass bans / kicks / unbans
- Unauthorized bot additions

**Auto-recovery:** Deleted channels and roles are automatically restored. Unauthorized guild changes are reverted. Re-bans are issued if a protected user is unbanned without permission.

### AntiRaid
Stops server raids by monitoring member join patterns.

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| Anti Mass Join | Detects and blocks rapid join bursts |
| Account Age Filter | Blocks accounts below a minimum age |
| Bot Filter | Blocks unauthorized bots from joining |

### Automod
Advanced message filtering with a strike-based escalation system.

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| Anti Promotion / Links | Blocks unauthorized invite links and URLs |
| Anti Spam | Prevents message flooding |

**Strike system:** Violations are tracked per user. Punishments escalate automatically — Delete → Timeout → Kick → Ban — based on a configurable threshold.

## Architecture Notes

- **Priority execution:** The bot process runs at the highest OS priority (`-20`) to ensure security events are handled before anything else.
- **Task queue:** A batching task queue allows the bot to issue mass bans rapidly during a nuke attempt without hitting rate limits.
- **Local cache:** Antinuke status and whitelists are stored in LMDB for near-instant reads with zero database latency during critical events.
